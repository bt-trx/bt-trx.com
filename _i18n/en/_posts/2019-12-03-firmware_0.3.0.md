# Firmware version 0.3.0 has been released - support for BLE PTT Button

Today the [Firmware Version 0.3.0](https://github.com/bt-trx/firmware/releases/tag/0.3.0) was released.

The most important change for users is the ability to use the Anytone PTT Button
of the Anytone AT-D878UV (BP-01) with bt-trx, see [bt-trx manual](https://manual.bt-trx.com/30_Bedienung/Inbetriebnahme/#ble-bluetooth-low-energy-ptt-button).

**Important note:** For an update from firmware version 0.2.0 or 0.2.1 to
0.3.0, the update cannot be performed via the web interface. The update
must be done via USB (see documentation in the [bt-trx manual](https://manual.bt-trx.com/40_Entwicklung/Flashen%20der%20Firmware%20%C3%BCber%20USB/)).
