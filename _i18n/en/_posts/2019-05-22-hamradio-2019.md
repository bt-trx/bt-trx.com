# Presentation of bt-trx at the HAM RADIO 2019 in Friedrichshafen

Motivated by the [DARC e.V.](https://darc.de) "Handsfree construction competition" we have developed the bt-trx for all radio amateurs and CB radio operators.

At the [HAM RADIO 2019](https://www.hamradio-friedrichshafen.de) in Friedrichshafen the award ceremony for the competition participants will take place. Besides the event on the DARC stage on Saturday 22.06.2019 at 17:00 we can also be found on the HAM RADIO for the whole weekend. There you can try out the bt-trx and enter into dialogue with the developers.
