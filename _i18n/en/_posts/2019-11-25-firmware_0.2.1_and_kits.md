# Firmware version 0.2.1 has been released, DIY kits available again

The day before yesterday the [Firmware Version 0.2.1](https://github.com/bt-trx/firmware/releases/tag/0.2.1) was released. The most important change for users is
the possibility to configure bt-trx via the WLAN web interface.
In version 0.2.1, the following settings can be configured via the web interface:

* ADC and DAC gain (volume of the audio signals from and to the transceiver)
* 4-digit PIN code for Legacy Bluetooth Pairing
* Delete all Bluetooth pairings
* PTT Hang Time (Hold the PTT signal after releasing the PTT button
  to compensate for the delay of the cars' hands-free system)

In addition, the two headset models "Fontastic NAT+" and "Jabra Evolve 65" have been
reported to be compatible to bt-trx.
