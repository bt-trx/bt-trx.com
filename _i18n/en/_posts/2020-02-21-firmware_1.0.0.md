# Firmware version 1.0.0 has been released

Today the [Firmware Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/bt-trx/firmware/releases/tag/1.0.0) was released.

We dared the jump to the "magic" version number 1.0.0, because we
had no major problems with the software so far and currently all features
that we wanted to implement are done.

As new features in version 1.0.0 we have added the possibility to activate PTT with a
button press, and deactivate it with another button press (PTT Latch).
In order to prevent PTT from remaining activated for a longer period of time by
mistake, we have added a TOT (maximum Time of Transmit).
Both can be configured in the web interface.

If you still have suggestions how the software can be improved, tell us!

**Important note:** To update from firmware version 0.2.0 or 0.2.1 to
1.0.0 the update cannot be done via the web interface. The update
must be made via USB (see documentation in the [bt-trx manual](https://manual.bt-trx.com/40_Entwicklung/Flashen%20der%20Firmware%20%C3%BCber%20USB/)).
