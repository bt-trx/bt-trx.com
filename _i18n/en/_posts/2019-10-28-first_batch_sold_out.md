# First edition of kits sold out

Since today the first edition of the bt-trx v4.1 kits is sold out. We had limited the quantity of kits on purpose 
to gather experience and feedback in a smaller circle of users.
After we have received the first feedback, we will incorporate the suggestions for improvement and then launch
 the next (larger) round.

Hence the call to all those who have now received a kit: Please contact us with positive or negative feedback :)

If someone is interested in a cooperation for the production/distribution of the kits (or maybe someday 
of a complete product), we look forward to hearing from you.

Here again the reference to the Telegram group and the forum:

For exchange of experiences and support we have the Telegram Group
[bt-trx](https://t.me/bttrxcom).

More in-depth exchange and discussion on further development will take place in the [Forum](https://forum.bt-trx.com).
