# Manufacturing data for the front panel is now available

In order to make the installation of bt-trx into the housing even easier, we now have two types of assistance:

- Template (PDF) of the cutouts of the front panel, and
- 3D data (STL file) to create your own front panel with the appropriate cut-outs using the 3D printer.

Links to the data can be found in the [Manual](https://manual.bt-trx.com/20_Zusammenbau/Frontblende/).

If you don't have access to a 3D-printer, you can buy a printed version in the [shop](https://shop.thinkstack.de) starting on Monday.
