# Project Update August 2019

## Firmware

Our latest tests with the new configuration parameters for the WT32i 
Bluetooth module were very successful. It is now possible to connect
also with radios of current vehicle models by e.g. VW and Ford without any problems.

There have also been improvements in the detection of incoming connections.

All these changes can be found in the firmware version [0.1.2](https://github.com/bt-trx/firmware/releases/tag/0.1.2).

## Hardware

The fourth version of the bt-trx development board ("dev-board v4") is now finished 
and prototypes are being produced.
The most significant change is the use of ESP32 as the controller, 
but there were also other changes made to make the board as simple and cheap as possible.

If everything goes according to plan, this will also be the version that we'll supply
as a kit. Currently it is planned to offer the kit from the beginning of October on [shop.thinkstack.de](https://shop.thinkstack.de).   
Probably we will take preorders starting from September, so its worthwile to have a look from time to time!
