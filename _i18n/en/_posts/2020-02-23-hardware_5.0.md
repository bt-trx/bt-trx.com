# dev-board hardware version 5.0 was released

Today the [hardware version 5.0](https://github.com/bt-trx/dev-board/releases/tag/v5.0) of the dev-board was released.

With this release we address some optimization potentials that were mentioned
by users of the version 4.1.
These are among others:

- Use of transformers for the audio signals
- Strict separation of Digital Ground and Analog Ground
- Use of an optocoupler for PTT
- Possibility of free configuration of the RJ45 socket pinout

An exact list of the changes can be found in the link above.
