Therefore we had to rework the layout,\nwhich resulted in v4.1.\nThis has the advantage that we have even more improvements in the version.\n\nThe work on the firmware for the ESP32 was also very successful.\nIt is now possible to use the PTT button to set up the telephone call.\nand to install firmware updates via the WLAN of ESP32.\nVersion v0.1.3 will be shipped with the first kits.\n\nKits available\n\nNow we are happy to announce that there is a first, limited edition\nof the bt-trx kits in the thinkstack Shop\navailable for ordering. The kits will be shipped within the next 3 weeks.\nWe want to collect experiences of the first users and improve the\ndocumentation in order to make it as easy as possible for a wider range\nof users.\n\n\ndev-board v4.1\n"

It is now possible to connect\nalso with radios of current vehicle models by e.g. VW and Ford without any problems.\n\nThere have also been improvements in the detection of incoming connections.\n\nAll these changes can be found in the firmware version 0.1.2.\n\nHardware\n\nThe fourth version of the bt-trx development board (“dev-board v4”) is now finished \nand prototypes are being produced.\nThe most significant change is the use of ESP32 as the controller, \nbut there were also other changes made to make the board as simple and cheap as possible.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, this will also be the version that we’ll supply\nas a kit. Currently it is planned to offer the kit from the beginning of October on shop.thinkstack.de. \nProbably we will take preorders starting from September, so its worthwile to have a look from time to time!\n\n\n3D Rendering dev-board v4\n"

        "content"  : "Here is a small update on the progress of the project\n\nFirmware\n\nIn the meantime, we had the opportunity again to test the current version of the\nbt-trx firmware (0.1.0) with further radio models. It turns out that\naccessory radios usually work without problems. Some manufacturer radios, on\nthe other hand, cannot currently be connected.\nWe already have a few configuration values of the WT32i Bluetooth module that\nshould fix this problem and will do some tests soon.\n\nHardware\n\nWe are currently in the process of developing the fourth version of the bt-trx\ndevelopment board.\nThe most significant change is that instead of the Teensy 3.2 module, we’ll switch\nto an ESP32.\nThis is mainly because the ESP32 will cost about half of the price of the\nTeensy module. As a further advantage, the ESP32 offers integrated\nWifi, which we may use in the future for configuration and firmware updates\nof the bt-trx. With the integrated Bluetooth LE we can e.g.\nwirelessly connect a PTT button.\n\nAs soon as we are finished with the development of v4, we will get started to \nmake bt-trx kits available.\n"

The five participants of the competition had the opportunity to present their projects to the audience and to the jury.\nThe jury consisted among others of the DARC board members Werner Bauer, DJ2ET\nand Christian Entsfellner, DL3MBG.\n\nbt-trx was finally able to assert itself against the other projects and\nwas chosen as the winner by the jury. The jury particularly praised the advanced\ndevelopment stage and the focus on cost-effective reproducibility of the project.\n\nThe 1st prize was awarded with a voucher of 150 € for the DARC Verlag Shop.\n\nAndreas Müller, DC1MIL with the main prize\n"
