The five participants of the competition had the opportunity to present their projects to the audience and to the jury.\nThe jury consisted among others of the DARC board members Werner Bauer, DJ2ET\nand Christian Entsfellner, DL3MBG.\n\nbt-trx was finally able to assert itself against the other projects and\nwas chosen as the winner by the jury. The jury particularly praised the advanced\ndevelopment stage and the focus on cost-effective reproducibility of the project.\n\nThe 1st prize was awarded with a voucher of 150 € for the DARC Verlag Shop.\n\nAndreas Müller, DC1MIL with the main prize\n"
